*1. What are mutable integers?*

Normal integers in Python (_int_ and/or _long_) and *gmpy2* (_mpz_) are immutable: the value of an integer object does not change unless the object itself changes. The _xmpz_ (eXperimental MPZ) type allows the in-place operations to modify the value of an object without creating a new object. 

The following code example shows the behavior of immutable and mutable integers:

{{{
>>> import gmpy2
>>> a=1
>>> b=a
>>> a+=1
>>> a
2
>>> b
1
>>> a=gmpy2.xmpz(1)
>>> b=a
>>> a+=1
>>> a
xmpz(2)
>>> b
xmpz(2)
}}}

In the first part of the example, `a+=1` creates a new object so the value of `b` is unchanged. In the second part of the example, the value of `b` changed after evaluating `a+=1`.

Python dictionaries assume the value of an object never changes so _xmpz_ objects cannot be used as keys in a dictionary.

*2. When should _xmpz_ be used?*

If you have a program that performs a sequence of in-place operations, then using _xmpz_ may be slightly faster (~10%). Certain operations, such as adding or subtracting a small value from a very large number, may be much faster. _xmpz_ only have performance advantages for in-place operations.

(Historical note: In theory, _xmpz_ should provide a more substantial performance improvement since new objects do not need to be created. However, *gmpy2* and recent versions of *gmpy* include object caching that eliminate much of the penalty for creating new objects.)
