TODO List

The gmpy2 2.1.0 release should be stable for mathematical functions available 
to the end-user. The minimum function set should be based on MPFR 3.2 and
MPF 1.03 but additional functions from MPFR 4.1 and MPC 1.10 should also
be available.

Functions to add/verify
=======================

MPFR related functions
----------------------

* Add mpfr_erandom and  mpfr_nrandom functions.

* Add  mpfr_fmodquo function.

* Add mpfr_rint_roundeven and mpfr_roudneven functions.

* Check behavior of mpfr_get_str for NaN input and the setting of the inexact
  flag.

* Check behavior of mpfr_set_exp. 

MPC related functions
---------------------

* Add mpc_cmp and mpc_cmp_abs functions.

* Add mpc_rootofunity function.

Improve Test Suite and Documentation
====================================

More testing needs to be done.

Internal Cleanup
================

The following internal changes should be done but will occur after the 2.1.0
release.

* Support the modern Python 3.2+ Unicode functions.

* Support new thread local storage functions.

* Support proper module initialization (??).
