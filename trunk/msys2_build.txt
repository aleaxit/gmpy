Building gmpy2 with MSYS2
=========================

From the MSYS2 home page:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/

MSYS2 is a Cygwin-derived Posix-like environment for Windows. The name is a
contraction of Minimal SYStem 2, and aims to provide support to facilitate
using the bash shell, Autotools, revision control systems and the like for
building native Windows applications using MinGW-w64 toolchains.

Installing MSYS2
================

MSYS2 installation instructions can be found at:

http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/

After following the upgrade steps documented above, you will need to install
the MinGW compiler toolchain. To install the 64-bit toolchain:

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

To install the 32-bit toolchain:

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain

The following additional packages should also be installed:

$ pacman -S patch m4 lzip wget tar make diff

The MSYS2 build environment
===========================

The build process is split into two phases. During phase 1 we use the MSYS2
environment to build statically linked versions of GMP, MPFR, and MPC. Once
those libraries are build, we will use the Windows command prompt to build
the actual gmpy2 extension (DLL). We do not use the versions of Python
included with MSYS2 to compile gmpy2.

Commands that must be executed from an MSYS2 shell are preceded by "$".
Commands that must be executed from a Windows command prompt are preceded
by ">". You will need to run the commands *after* "$" or ">".

The MSYS2 environment provides three different command line operating
environments.

 * msys2_shell.bat is the general-purpose shell but it does not provide
   access to the MinGW compiler suite.
 * mingw64_shell.bat provides access to the 64-bit MinGW compiler suite.
 * mingw32_shell.bat provides access to the 32-bit MinGW compiler suite.

 MSYS2 does include versions of GMP, MPFR, and MPC but we will compile our
 own version directly from the source. We will specify the options that are
 appropriate for building a statically linked Windows DLL.

# Start the appropriate shell: mingw64_shell.bat or mingw32_shell.bat.

# Create a new directory for our custom builds.
  $ mkdir /opt
  $ mkdir /opt/src

# Download and uncompress GMP, MPFR, and MPC
  $ cd /opt/src

# Download GMP
  $ wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.0.0a.tar.lz
  $ tar xf gmp-6.0.0a.tar.lz

# Download MPFR and any patches
  $ wget http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr-3.1.2.tar.bz2
  $ cd mpfr-3.1.2/
  $ wget http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/allpatches
  $ patch -N -Z -p1 < allpatches
  $ cd ..

# Download MPC
  $ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/mpc-1.0.2.tar.gz
  $ tar xf mpc-1.0.2.tar.gz

# Compile GMP
  $ cd gmp-6.0.0/
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt --enable-static --disable-shared --enable-fat --with-pic
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install
  $ cd ..

# Compile MPFR
  $ cd mpfr-3.1.2/
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt --enable-static --disable-shared --with-pic --with-gmp=/opt
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install
  $ cd ..

# Compile MPC
  $ cd mpc-1.0.2/
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt --enable-static --disable-shared --with-pic --with-gmp=/opt --with-mpfr=/opt
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install
  $ cd ..

The Windows build environment
=============================

# Configure Windows command prompt
  The MinGW toolchain must be accessible by the normal Windows installation of
  Python. The 64-bit MinGW toolchain is located in C:\msys64\mingw64\bin. The
  32-bit MinGW toolchain is located in C:\msys64\mingw32\bin. The MinGW
  location can be added to the system Path permanently or can be added manually
  after starting the Windows command prompt. We will do it manually. After
  starting the Windows command prompt, add either the 64-bit or 32-bit
  MinGW to the Path with one of the following commands:

  > set Path=C:\msys64\mingw64\bin;%Path%
  -- or --
  > set Path=C:\msys64\mingw32\bin;%Path%

  To verfiy the MinGW toolchain is accessible, the command "gcc -v" should
  return information about the gcc compiler.

  Note: All the remaining instructions assume this step has been completed and
        that "gcc -v" returns information for the correct version of gcc.

# Modify distutils library
  The gmpy2 extension is built using the distutils module. Recent versions of
  the gcc compiler no longer support an option that is used by older versions
  of distutils. In the file "cygwincompiler.py", remove all occurences of the
  "-mno-cygwin" option. The "-mno-cygwin" option was already removed in Python
  2.7.8, 3.3.5, and 3.4.1. The option was present in Python 2.6.6 and 3.2.5.
  You will need to check your specific version.

  In the file "cygwincompiler.py", find the definition for the class
  "Mingw32CCompiler". In the "__init__" function comment out the line:
  "self.dll_libraries = get_msvcr()".

  *Optional*
  In the file "cygwincompiler.py", find the definition for the class
  "Mingw32CCompiler". Under self.set_executables(...), change -O to -O2.
  This enables strict-aliasing checks so "-Wstrict-aliasing=0" should be added.
  Adding "-fwrapv" is probably a good idea, too.

# Create a libpython.a file
  MinGW requires a libpythonXX.a file that contains information about the C-API
  functions that exist in pythonXX.dll. Follow these steps for your version of
  Python.

  > cd C:\Python27\libs
  > gendef c:\Windows\System32\python27.dll
  > dlltool --dllname c:\Windows\System32\python27.dll --def python27.def --output-lib libpython27.a

# Patch C:\Python27\include\pyconfig.h
  In that file search for the text #ifdef _WIN64 and cut out the following
  three lines:

  #ifdef _WIN64
  #define MS_WIN64
  #endif

  Search for the text #ifdef _MSC_VER earlier in the file. Paste in the
  cut-out lines, ABOVE the #ifdef _MSC_VER.

# To compile gmpy2
  py27 setup.py build_ext --msys2 --prefix=c:\msys64\opt

# To install to a local Python installation (after compiling)
  py27 setup.py install
