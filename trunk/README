Installing gmpy2 on Unix/Linux
------------------------------

Requirements

gmpy2 has only been tested with the most recent versions of GMP, MPFR and MPC.
Specifically, for integer and rational support, gmpy2 requires GMP 5.0.x or
later. To support multiple-precision floating point arithmetic, MPFR 3.1.x or
later is required. MPC 1.0.1 or later is required for complex arithmetic.

The MPC and MPFR libraries are optional. If the MPC library is not available,
gmpy2 will still support integer, rational, and real floating-point arithmetic.
If the MPFR library is not available, gmpy2 will only support integer and
rational arithmetic. The mpf type included with GMP is no longer supported.

Quick Instructions

If your system includes sufficiently recent versions of GMP, MPFR and MPC, and
you have the development libraries installed, compiling should be as simple as:

    $ cd <gmpy2 source directory>
    $ python setup.py install

If this fails, read on.

Detailed Instructions

If your Linux distribution does not support recent versions of GMP, MPFR and
MPC, you will need to compile your own versions. To avoid any possible conflict
with existing libraries on your system, the following instructions install GMP,
MPFR and MPC in a separate directory. The examples use /opt/local but you can
use another directory if you choose.

Create the desired destination directory for GMP, MPFR, and MPC.

    $ mkdir /opt/local

Download and un-tar the GMP source code. Change to GMP source directory and
compile GMP.

    $ cd /opt/local/src/gmp-5.1.0
    $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/local
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

Download and un-tar the MPFR source code. Change to MPFR source directory
and compile MPFR.

    $ cd /opt/local/mpfr-3.1.1
    $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/local --with-gmp=/opt/local
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

Download and un-tar the MPC source code. Change to MPC source directory
and compile MPC.

    $ cd /opt/local/mpc-1.0.1
    $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/local --with-gmp=/opt/local --with-mpfr=/opt/local
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

Compile gmpy2 and specify the location of GMP, MPFR and MPC. The location of
the GMP, MPFR, and MPC libraries is embedded into the gmpy2 library so the new
versions of GMP, MPFR, and MPC do not need to be installed the system library
directories.

    $ python setup.py build_ext -Ddir=/opt/local install

If you get a "permission denied" error message, you may need to use::

    $ sudo python setup.py build_ext -Ddir=/home/opt/local install
