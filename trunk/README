General MultiPrecision arithmetic for Python -- i.e., Python 2.2/.3/2.4/2.5
interface module for library GMP 4 -- release 1.02 beta (Nov 2005).

Detailed documentation in subdirectory doc.

To install gmpy 1.02 from sources (you need to have Python 2.2 or better, and
GMP 4, previously installed): at a shell prompt, python setup.py install

Note that, on Windows, you may use the distributed binary release, rather
than having to rebuid from sources; to build from sources, you need a
Windows installation of GMP 4 (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/exact/core/gmp/).

To test your installation: cd test, then python gmpy_test.py
