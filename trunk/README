General MultiPrecision arithmetic for Python -- i.e., Python 2.3/2.4/2.5/2.6
interface module for library GMP 4 -- release 1.03 (June 2008).

The gmpy project is moving to Google Code:
    http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/
Please check that site for better-updated sources, docs, etc.

Detailed documentation in subdirectory doc.

To install gmpy 1.03 from sources (you need to have Python 2.3 or better, and
GMP 4, previously installed): at a shell prompt, python setup.py install

Note that, on Windows, you may use the distributed binary release, rather
than having to rebuild from source. To build GMP and GMPY from source, see the
file "windows_build.txt".

Binary installations are also available for MacOSX (and for many Linux
distributions, but those are not distributed by the gmpy project).

To test your installation: cd test, then python gmpy_test.py

For any support request, mail Alex Martelli, aleaxit@gmail.com (or, better, use
the issues and wiki entries of the Google Code URL previously given).
