How to build gmpy with XCode 3 and Mac OS X 10.5.

- install macports AKA darwinports, see http://darwinports.com/
  (you do need to install XCode 3 first); no need to set PATH &c
  or install X11 etc etc, if all you need is to build gmpy

- instructions at http://gmp.darwinports.com/ are wrong, just do (after install
  & selfupdate of darwinports): sudo /opt/local/bin/port install gmp

- now, 'python setup.py install' should work just fine

- verify with python test/gmpy_test.py -- expect at the end of the output:
  1163 passed and 0 failed.
  Test passed.

For older systems, or to try and do without XCode, see:
  http://gmpy.googlecode.com/files/gmpy-1.02.macosx.README.txt
and good luck!
