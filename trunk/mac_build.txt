With GMP 4.2.3 (which unfortunately has a bug badly affecting gmpy) and the
current (as of today 10/16/08) 4.2.4, GMP appears to build effortlessly and
seamlessly on XCode 3 and Mac OS X 10.5 (fingers crossed...!-).  Just download
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/gmp-4.2.4.tar.bz2 -- and do the usual dance of
software build and install: tar xjf, cd gmp-4.2.4, ./configure, make, make check
(make sure to scroll back or use |less to verify all tests pass), sudo make
install.  Here's hoping everything stays THAT easy;-).  ((Note: you WILL get a
warning from ld when you use this setup to build gmpy, but [fingers again
crossed] it looks like the warning is benign, as gmpy does pass tests)).

If that doesn't work for you try darwinports (which unfortunately currently
comes with the buggy 4.2.3, sigh, so some gmpy tests WILL fail -- they're for a
somewhat marginal part of gmpy, if you don't use set_fcoform you should still be
OK..):

How to build gmpy with XCode 3 and Mac OS X 10.5 (one easy way):

- install macports AKA darwinports, see http://darwinports.com/
  (you do need to install XCode 3 first); no need to set PATH &c
  or install X11 etc etc, if all you need is to build gmpy

- instructions at http://gmp.darwinports.com/ are wrong, just do (after install
  & selfupdate of darwinports): sudo /opt/local/bin/port install gmp

- now, 'python setup.py install' should work just fine

- verify with python test/gmpy_test.py -- expect at the end of the output:
  1172 passed and 0 failed.
  Test passed.

For older systems, or to try and do without XCode, see:
  http://gmpy.googlecode.com/files/gmpy-1.02.macosx.README.txt
and good luck!
