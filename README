gmpy2 is an optimized, C-coded Python extension module that supports fast
multiple-precision arithmetic.  gmpy2 is based on the original gmpy module.
gmpy2 adds support for correctly rounded multiple-precision real arithmetic
(using the MPFR library) and complex arithmetic (using the MPC library).

gmpy2 2.1 was extensively refactored. Some of the significant changes are:

  * Support for thread-safe contexts and context methods
  * Interoperability with Cython extensions
  * mpz and mpq operation can release the GIL (controlled by the context)
  * Improved argument processing

gmpy2 is available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2/
