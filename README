Welcome to gmpy2 project!
-------------------------

gmpy2 provides fast multiple-precision arithmetic to Python. gmpy2 is an
optimized C extension that supports the GMP, MPFR, and MPC libraries.

gmpy2 is based on the original gmpy module. gmpy2 adds support for correctly
rounded multiple-precison real (using the MPFR library) and complex (using
the MPC library) arthmetic.

The gmpy2 2.0.x series is stable version that it only receiving bug fixes.
The main development branch (2.1.x) was extensively refactored. The most
significant changes are support for thread-safe contexts and context methods.

gmpy2 2.0.x is available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2.

To install install a development version of gmpy2 2.1.x, just close or copy
the repository and follow the instructions in the INSTALL file. Detailed
instructions for building on Windows using the MSYS2/MINGW-W64 tool chain
can be found in msys2_build.txt
