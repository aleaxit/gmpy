gmpy2 is an optimized, C-coded Python extension module that supports fast
multiple-precision arithmetic.  gmpy2 is based on the original gmpy module.
gmpy2 adds support for correctly rounded multiple-precision real arithmetic
(using the MPFR library) and complex arithmetic (using the MPC library).

The gmpy2 2.0.x series is a stable version that is only receiving bug fixes.
The main development branch (2.1.x) was extensively refactored. The most
significant changes are support for thread-safe contexts and context methods.

gmpy2 is available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2/
