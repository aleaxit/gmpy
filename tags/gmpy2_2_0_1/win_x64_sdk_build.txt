        Building MPIR and GMPY using the Windows SDK tools

It is possible to build MPIR and GMPY from source on a Microsoft Windows
platform using the command-line compiler that is included with the Microsoft
Platform SDK. I've documented the process for a 64-bit build. The operating
system was Windows XP x64. The process isn't difficult but assumes some
familiarity with the command line.

1)  You should have an program for processing .zip and .tar.gz archives.

2)  Python should be installed on your system and the installation
    directory should be added to your system's PATH environment variable.

3)  Install .NET Framework 2.0 or later. (This is required for the
    installer used by the SDK.)

4)  Install the Microsoft Windows SDK. I used "Microsoft Windows SDK for
    Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1". It can be found at
    "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx". Use the
    version appropriate for your system: X86 for a 32-bit system or AMD64
    for a 64-bit system.

5)  Download the current version of the YASM assembler. It can be found at
    "http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/". Again, use the version approp-
    riate for your system.

    The executable must be renamed to "yasm.exe" and copied to the SDK
    installation directory, typically:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin

6)  Create a directory to use for the build process. I used C:\src.

    mkdir c:\src

7)  Download the GMPY and MPIR source code. This example uses
    gmpy-1.12.zip and mpir-2.1.1.tar.gz. They should be unzipped
    (or untarred) into c:\src. There should be c:\src\gmpy-1.12
    and c:\src\mpir-2.1.1 directories in c:\src.

8)  The file "yasm.rules" must be copied from

    c:\src\mpir-2.1.1\build.vc9\

    to

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\VCProjectDefaults

9)  Open a command window and enter the following commands:

    rem Configure the environment for 64-bit builds.
    rem Use "vcvars32.bat" for a 32-bit build.
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\vcvars64.bat"

    rem Build mpir first.
    cd C:\src\mpir-2.1.1\build.vc9

    rem Check contents of configure.bat to see allowed options. Verify that
    rem all tests pass.
    rem 64-bit binaries were built with --cpu-k8.
    configure
    make
    make check

    rem Copy the required to a convenient location for gmpy.
    rem The files are located in "lib\Win32\release" for 32-bit
    rem build.
    mkdir c:\src\lib
    mkdir c:\src\include
    xcopy /Y lib\x64\release\*.h c:\src\include\*.*
    xcopy /Y lib\x64\release\*.??b c:\src\lib\*.*

    rem Done with mpir, now build gmpy.
    cd c:\src\gmpy-1.12

    rem Convince setup.py to use the SDK tools.
    set MSSdk=1
    set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1

    rem Build and install gmpy.pyd
    python setup.py build_ext -DMPIR -Ic:\src\include -Lc:\src\lib install

    rem Run the test suite
    python test\gmpy_test.py

    rem (Optional) Build an installer, located in c:\src\gmpy-1.12\dist.
    python setup.py bdist_wininst
