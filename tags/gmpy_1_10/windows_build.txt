Instructions for compiling GMPY for Windows.

GMPY binaries can be compiled for the Windows operating systems using
the free MinGW toolkit. The MinGW toolkit provides a Minimalist GNU
for Windows environment.

1) Download and install MinGW-5.1.4.exe. Choose the "current" release.

2) Download and install MSYS-1.0.10.exe.

3) The following instructions assume that both Python and gcc (part of
   MinGW) exist on the operating system PATH. On Windows XP, this can be
   done using Settings -> Control Panel -> System -> Environment Variables.

   If not already present, add c:\python25 and c:\mingw\bin to the PATH.
   The entries should be separated by a semi-colon. Note: Python 2.5 is
   used in this example.

4) A icon entitled "MSYS" should be created on the desktop. It provides
   a GNU-compatible command line interface. Start MSYS and create a
   directory that will contain the GMP and GMPY source code. C:\src will
   be used for this build. Note that /c/src is the MSYS equivalent of
   C:\src.

   $ mkdir /c/src

5) Download the GMP source code and save it in C:\src. For this example,
   I used gmp-4.2.1.tar.gz.

6) Download the GMPY source code and save it in C:\src. For this example,
   I used gmpy-1.03.zip and I assume the files are save in C:\src\gmpy.

7) Using MSYS, compile GMP. The resulting files are installed in C:\src.

   $ cd /c/src
   $ gunzip gmp-4.2.1.tar.gz
   $ tar -xf gmp-4.2.1.tar
   $ cd gmp-4.2.1
   $ ./configure --prefix=/c/src
   $ make
   $ make install

8) Unzip GMPY. The instructions assume the unzipped files are in the
   C:\src\gmpy directory. Use the Windows command line for these commands.

   > cd C:\src\gmpy
   > python setup.py build_ext -cmingw32 -Ic:\src\include -Lc:\src\lib -f install
   > python test\gmpy_test.py

Miscellaneous notes on compiling GMP and GMPY

The binaries made available at http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/ are compiled
using GMP 4.2.1.

You may get better performance by compiling GMP and GMPY from source. There
are versions of GMP available on the Internet that provide faster performance
on specific processors. For example, a Core2 specific version of GMP is
available at http://www.geocities.jp/ct35z/gmp-core2-en.html. This version is
approximately 30% faster than the stock GMP 4.2.2.
